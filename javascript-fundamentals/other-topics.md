### First-class Functions

When functions in that language are treated like any other variable.
A function can be passed as an argument to other functions, can be returned by another function and can be assigned as a value to a variable.

## Higher Order Functions

A higher order function is a function that takes one or more functions as arguments, or returns a function as its result.
- ex - map, reduce, fliter etc.
- compose from Redux.
